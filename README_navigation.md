# Navigation Package Overview

The `navigation` package in ROS provides a comprehensive framework for enabling autonomous navigation of mobile robots in 2D environments. It allows robots to efficiently move from one point to another while avoiding obstacles and ensuring safe, smooth travel through both known and unknown spaces.

## What the Navigation Package Does

### 1. Global Path Planning
The `navigation` package computes the optimal path for a robot to reach a specified goal, considering static obstacles like walls and furniture. This is achieved through a **global planner** (e.g., `NavFn`), which plans paths on a known map of the environment.

### 2. Local Path Planning
The **local planner** (e.g., `DWA` or `TEB`) handles real-time obstacle avoidance and path adjustments as the robot moves through its environment. The local planner ensures smooth motion and dynamically avoids obstacles that may appear unexpectedly.

### 3. Costmaps
The package maintains two important costmaps:
- **Global Costmap**: Covers the entire environment and includes static obstacles.
- **Local Costmap**: Covers the area immediately surrounding the robot and is used for real-time obstacle avoidance. Both costmaps represent the environment in terms of free space, obstacles, and the cost of navigating through different areas.

### 4. Input Requirements
To perform autonomous navigation, the `navigation` package requires:
- **Map**: A 2D occupancy grid map of the environment (usually generated by SLAM or loaded from a file) for global path planning.
- **Sensor Data**: Inputs from laser scanners, depth cameras, or other sensors to detect obstacles in real time.
- **Odometry**: Information about the robot's movement, such as velocity and direction, is used for localization and path adjustment during navigation.

### 5. Navigation Goals
The robot is given a navigation goal (a specific location in the environment), and the `navigation` package autonomously computes the best path, manages obstacle avoidance, and adjusts as necessary to reach the destination.

### 6. Recovery Behaviors
If the robot encounters challenges, such as becoming stuck or encountering obstacles it cannot avoid, the package includes **recovery behaviors** like rotating in place or clearing the local costmap to help the robot recover and continue its journey.

## Use Cases
- **Autonomous Robots**: This package is essential for robots operating in indoor or outdoor structured environments where autonomous navigation is required.
- **Service Robots**: The `navigation` package is commonly used in service robots that need to autonomously navigate through homes, warehouses, or offices to perform tasks like delivery, cleaning, or inspection.

## How It Works
1. **Path Planning**: A global path is planned based on a known map and a specified goal.
2. **Real-Time Obstacle Avoidance**: Local planners adjust the path and avoid dynamic obstacles in real time.
3. **Goal Reaching**: The robot safely reaches its destination using sensor inputs and costmap updates.
