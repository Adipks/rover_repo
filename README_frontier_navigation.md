# Frontier Exploration Package Overview

The `frontier_exploration` package in ROS enables autonomous exploration of unknown environments by mobile robots. It works alongside SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) packages, such as `slam_gmapping`, and the navigation stack to allow robots to discover and map previously unexplored areas without human intervention.

## What Frontier Exploration Does

### 1. Exploration
The package identifies "frontiers," which are the boundaries between known (mapped) and unknown (unmapped) areas in the robot's environment. The robot is directed toward these frontiers, allowing it to gather data and map the unknown areas.

### 2. Goal Assignment
Once frontiers are identified, the package assigns navigation goals to the robot. The robot autonomously moves toward these goals, using its navigation stack to explore the frontier areas.

### 3. Input Requirements
To function effectively, the `frontier_exploration` package requires:
- **2D Occupancy Grid Map**: This is usually provided by a SLAM package (e.g., `slam_gmapping`). The map allows the package to differentiate between known and unknown areas.
- **Navigation Stack**: The robot's navigation stack is used to move the robot toward the detected frontiers safely and efficiently.

### 4. Autonomous Exploration
As the robot moves and explores the frontiers, the map is updated, and new frontiers are identified. This continuous process enables the robot to fully explore the environment.

## Use Cases
- **Robotic Exploration**: This package is ideal for robots exploring unknown indoor or outdoor environments, helping them create detailed maps autonomously.
- **Service Robots**: It can be applied to service robots like cleaning robots, inspection robots, or any robot requiring autonomous navigation and exploration capabilities.

## How it Works
1. The robot starts with an incomplete map of the environment.
2. The `frontier_exploration` package identifies unexplored regions (frontiers) and sets them as goals.
3. The robot moves toward these frontiers and gathers new data to map these areas.
4. The process continues until all frontiers are explored, resulting in a complete map.
