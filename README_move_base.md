# Move Base Package Overview

The `move_base` package in ROS is a key component of the navigation stack, providing a high-level interface that allows a robot to autonomously navigate to a goal position while avoiding obstacles. It integrates global and local planners, costmaps, and controllers to perform efficient path planning and execution.

## What the Move Base Package Does

### 1. Goal Navigation
`move_base` enables a robot to receive a navigation goal (a specific pose in the map) and then handles the planning and movement required to reach the goal, avoiding obstacles along the way.

### 2. Path Planning
- **Global Planner**: Calculates a path from the robot's current position to the goal based on the static map, accounting for known obstacles.
- **Local Planner**: Generates real-time, short-term paths that adjust to dynamic obstacles, ensuring safe navigation using sensor data.

### 3. Costmaps
- **Global Costmap**: A static map representing the known environment and obstacles.
- **Local Costmap**: Dynamically updated based on real-time sensor data (e.g., laser or depth cameras), allowing the robot to avoid dynamic obstacles.

### 4. Obstacle Avoidance
The robot continuously updates its local costmap with sensor data to avoid obstacles while moving toward the goal.

### 5. Controller
The controller translates the planned path into velocity commands that are sent to the robot's base, allowing it to move along the desired path.

## How `move_base` Works

1. The robot receives a goal pose.
2. The **global planner** calculates a path to the goal.
3. The **local planner** refines the path in real-time, adjusting for obstacles and executing velocity commands to move the robot safely.
4. The robotâ€™s movement is continuously monitored and adjusted based on sensor input, avoiding obstacles while following the global path.

## How to Configure Move Base

### 1. Move Base Parameters

The main configuration file, typically `move_base_params.yaml`, sets the core parameters for `move_base`:

```yaml
base_global_planner: "navfn/NavfnROS"            # Global planner plugin
base_local_planner: "dwa_local_planner/DWAPlannerROS"  # Local planner plugin
controller_frequency: 10.0                       # Frequency of velocity command updates
planner_frequency: 5.0                           # Frequency of re-planning
```

### 2. Costmap Configuration

Separate parameter files configure the global and local costmaps, such as `global_costmap_params.yaml` and `local_costmap_params.yaml`.

#### Example Global Costmap Configuration:
```yaml
global_costmap:
  global_frame: "map"
  robot_base_frame: "base_link"
  update_frequency: 5.0
  static_map: true
```

#### Example Local Costmap Configuration:
```yaml
local_costmap:
  global_frame: "odom"
  robot_base_frame: "base_link"
  update_frequency: 5.0
  rolling_window: true
  width: 3.0
  height: 3.0
```

### 3. Global Planner Configuration

Example `NavfnROS` configuration for global planning:

```yaml
NavfnROS:
  allow_unknown: true               # Enable path planning through unknown areas
  planner_window: 0.5
  default_tolerance: 0.5
```

### 4. Local Planner Configuration (DWA or TEB)

#### Example DWA Local Planner Configuration:
```yaml
DWAPlannerROS:
  max_vel_x: 0.5                    # Maximum forward velocity
  min_vel_x: 0.1
  max_vel_theta: 1.0                # Maximum rotational velocity
  min_vel_theta: 0.1
  acc_lim_x: 2.5                    # Acceleration limit in X direction
  acc_lim_theta: 3.2                # Acceleration limit in rotational direction
```

### 5. Launching Move Base

Create a launch file to run `move_base`, like this:

```xml
<launch>
  <node pkg="move_base" type="move_base" name="move_base" output="screen">
    <param name="base_global_planner" value="navfn/NavfnROS"/>
    <param name="base_local_planner" value="dwa_local_planner/DWAPlannerROS"/>
    <rosparam file="$(find my_robot_navigation)/config/move_base_params.yaml" command="load"/>
    <rosparam file="$(find my_robot_navigation)/config/global_costmap_params.yaml" command="load"/>
    <rosparam file="$(find my_robot_navigation)/config/local_costmap_params.yaml" command="load"/>
  </node>
</launch>
```
